\section*{Question 1.}
{
    No, it is impossible to have 3 Bs in a row within this language.\\\\
    S 3 letter = {aab, aba, baa}.\\\\
    S 4 letter = {aaaa, abab, aaab, baaa, baab}.\\\\
    Let S* be the language that contains all the concatenations of its letters\\ alphabet S,
    defined by S = {a,  ab,  ba}.
}
\section*{Question 2.}
{
    S is the set of all two letter combinations made from the alphabet $\Sigma$ = {a, b}\\\\
    S div by 3 = {aaa, bbb, aaabbb, bbbaaa…}\\\\
    S* odd length = {a, b, aab, abb, bbb, aaa…}
}
\section*{Question 3.}
{
    The Kleene star closure of two infinite languages can be the same language even if the two sets were differing. Sets S and T both contain the letter ‘a’ and ‘b’, making any concatenation of them possible such that S* = T*\\\\
    The set S could never create the word ‘bbb’ as any concatenation of its letters would never produce the word ‘bbb’, thus S* != T* Despite this all the terms of set S are contained with set T meaning that S* is contained within T*.\\\\
    That even though a set may be infinite it does not mean that it can contain all possible terms and some sets have a more narrow scope than others.

}
\section*{Question 4.}
{
    BB is the set of all words that contain the substring ‘bb’.\\
    ‘bb’ is in BB.\\
    If w is any word in BB, then xw, aw, bw, wa, and wb are all in BB.\\\\
    NOTBB is the set of all words that do not contain the substring ‘bb’\\
    a and b are in NOTBB\\
    If w is any word in NOTBB, then wab and aw are in NOTBB\\\\\\\\
    EVEN is the set of all words that end in the digits {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\\
    0, 2, 4, 6, and, 8 are in EVEN\\
    If w is any word in EVEN, then w0, w2, w4, w6, and w8 are in EVEN\\\\
    1 is in ODD\\
    If w is any number in ODD, then w + 2 is in ODD\\\\
    {0, 1, 2,...9} is in NOTZERO\\
    If w is any string except ‘0’ in NOTZERO, then w0, w1, w2,...w9 are in NOTZERO

}
\section*{Question 5.}
{
    a and b are in PALINDROME\\
    If x is any word in PALINDROME, then axa, bxb, and xx are in PALINDROME
}
